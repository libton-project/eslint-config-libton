# AI Planning and Documentation

This directory contains the planning and design documents for the `eslint-config-libton` project. It is intended to help both AI and human contributors understand the project's goals, prior art, and development plan.

## Documents

- [Goals](./goal.md): Project goals and guiding principles
- [Plan](./plan.md): Technical plan, configuration details, and development tasks
- [Prior Art & References](./prior-art.md): Inspiration and references from other projects

## How to Use

- **For contributors:**
  - Start by reading [goal.md](./goal.md) to understand the project's purpose and direction.
  - Review [plan.md](./plan.md) for implementation details and current tasks.
  - Check [prior-art.md](./prior-art.md) for background and reference configurations.
- **For AI agents:**
  - Use these documents to maintain context, avoid duplicating prior work, and ensure alignment with project goals.

## Notes

- Keep this directory up to date as the project evolves.
- When making significant changes, update the relevant document and add a summary here if needed.
- This directory is not shipped with the npm package; it is for internal planning only.
